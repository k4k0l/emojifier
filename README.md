# Emojifier

This simple web application converts images or your webcam feed into a grid of emojis.

1. Select an image or start the camera.
2. The picture is divided into blocks that fit the art area (up to 1980px wide).
3. Each block's average colour is matched to a coloured emoji creating a pixel-art effect.
4. When using the camera the emoji art updates in real time.

Future versions will overlay emojis representing detected objects on top of the emoji art.
