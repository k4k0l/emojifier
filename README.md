# Emojifier

This simple web application converts an image or webcam snapshot into a grid of emojis.

1. Select an image or use your webcam.
2. The picture is divided into blocks that fit your screen width.
3. Each block's average colour is matched to a coloured emoji creating a pixelâ€‘art effect.
